### Meeting with Teresa to discuss Serverless Backend Options

Recommended backend build:
- [api gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/)
- [aurora / postgres](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/serverless/)
- run our apollo client as an EC2 instance
- add AWS services with lambda, just send as stringified code in supported language of choice through API gateway, this might be more stable than using a [custom runtime environment for dart](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/introducing-a-dart-runtime-for-aws-lambda/)
- [load balancer](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) when needed
